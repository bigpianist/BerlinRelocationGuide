# Berlin Anmeldung

Anmeldung directly translates to "registration" in German. The Anmeldung is what you need to do when you move to a new city in Germany (whether you're a foreigner or not). 

Our experience in Berlin: 

The number we called was (030)115. It's a much shorter number than usual, but it worked. You'll need to be going to any of the "Bürgeramts". [This](https://service.berlin.de/standort/122243/) one is is the one in Friedrichshain, for example (and it also has that central number listed on the right). 

Strategy: call in at 8:00 and ask if they have any free appointments for that day. We got a waiting number and a time for a particular office after we called in same day. 

You'll need the following:
1. letter from your landlord. Here's a [thread about it](https://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/topic/365506-anmeldung-landlord-letter/) (with a link to the form). 

2. your lease

3. a passport
