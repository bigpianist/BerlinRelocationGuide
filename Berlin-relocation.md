# Berlin relocation

Finding a permanent flat in Berlin can be an annoying task. You have to go through an application process, present several documents, some of which you can have access to only when you're in Berlin. 

**Tip 1** A good strategy is to look initially for a temporary solution and then move to a permanent flat after 3-4 months, once you've gathered all the material you need to make an application. 

**Tip 2** Look for flats near to underground stations. The underground network is pretty good in Berlin and you can quickly go anywhere.

Most apartments for rent in Berlin aren't furnished. Temporary solutions usually come with furniture. The rent for temporary apartments usually includes all bills (i.e., heating, electricity, internet). Always double check this, to be sure though!

If you're by yourself and don't mind sharing a flat, a cheaper solution might be to rent a room. This are easier to rent and to find.

# Renting process

Be prepared that it takes time and patience to rent a house in Berlin and that letting agencies, at least in my experience (Valerio), are quite slow at interacting with you. Below are some of the steps you usually have to follow when renting a flat from a letting agency: 

1. Contact letting agency
2. Fill out a tenancy information form with personal details about the tenants
3. Send support material (see next section)
4. View the flat - this seems to be mandatory!
5. Wait to see if your application is successful
6. Pay caution. 2 to 3 months of rent for permanent flats, usually 1 to 2 for temporary accommodations. 

# Documents you may be asked to provide when renting a place

- Scan of passport
- Proof of income (one of the following should work):
    - Work contract
    - Income for the previous 3 months
    - Bank statement
- Reference from previous landlord
- [SCHUFA](https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/what-is-schufa/) credit check (usually for permanent rent only)

# Suggested Berlin areas

- Kreuzberg - quite pricey, but great area
- Neukolln - cheaper and a bit more edgy
- Prenzlauer Berg - relatively costly, but amazing neighborhood
- Friedrichshain - great neighborhood
